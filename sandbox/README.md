# Sandbox

Quick experiments, code snippets, and concept tests. Not polished, often throwaway.

## Active Experiments
- `test-uv/` - Exploring UV Python package and project manager.

## Guidelines
- Each experiment gets its own folder
- Keep a quick note about what's being tested
- Delete when done or graduate to `/projects` if it grows
